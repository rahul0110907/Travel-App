      "description":"The moment you set foot in Jaipur, you will feel like everything has come straight out of the pages of some epic novel. Majestic buildings, tales of heroic battles, resplendent forts and palaces, and multi-faceted characters ? Rajasthan is one of the most colourful and flashiest states in all of India, and its capital Jaipur lives up to the same reputation as well. Jaipur is a vibrant amalgamation of the old and the new ? highly urbanized pockets and shopping areas have casually sprung up beside gleaming forts and palaces. Jaipur has long been one of the shiniest cultural jewels in the history of the Indian subcontinent, and the royal corridors of the famously named 'Pink City' offer up a plethora of adventures and activities that make for a memorable holiday experience.",

A city that has stood the test of time for thousands of years. In the words of Mark Twain, Older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, And looks twice as old as all of them put together. Varanasi, the city that is more than just the spiritual capital of India. The city which can be aptly described as a melting pot where both life and death come together. The city that you only need to visit once for it to stay with you forever.",
